# robotwars

This project is purely JavaScript, with a tiny bit of jQuery, HTML and CSS thrown in.

The remit was to write a small application that would allow two robots to be set up.  They would have some initial coordinates and some directions in which to move.  They would move alternately.  The winner would be declared if one robot was to move into a square already occupied by the other robot.

It did not need to ba an animated application, but I thought it would be fun to have the robots actually move around, so that's what I did.

Construct a grid.

Allow the user to set starting points and movements.

Start the war.

Find out the result.

To improve the functionality I added a few tweaks, such as giving the user the ability to edit the set of movements and to have a delay in the movements, which necessitates the use of a JavaScript callback.

All in all good fun and only took me about 4 hours.
